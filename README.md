# Hello there!
This is the code for my personal website project for both school and other reasons.

Some things I would like to add one day:
- [x] stars
- [ ] lightspeed lines
- [ ] cool car in sakura petals
- [ ] 3d printer printing
- [ ] plane flying through the sky
- [ ] plane density maps
- [ ] train passing by
- [ ] ghibli scene

## To my professor
To my professor, please run this locally using `npm install` then `npm run dev`. This shoud cause a local instance to start on port 3000. Feel free to follow me on GitHub!

The five basic interactions I have:
- [x] navbar handling
- [x] scrolling
- [x] portfolio interactivity
- [x] submit button
- [x] on hover effects

## Commands
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
